    <h1>Accreditation of Prior Learning (APL)</h1>
    <h2>= Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL, RoPL)</h2>
    <hr />
    <h2>General principles</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Student will find out what are the course requirements and compare her/his own skills (and possible work experience) to them.

        </li><li>APL/RPL/AHOT is usually possible only in the beginning of the course.
		</li><li>Grade received cannot be raised later.
		</li><li>Student is responsible for demonstrating all the skills and knowledge.
		</li><li>Remember that by RPL:ing courses there is always something you miss. Something that might not even read in course description. So don't say "in the school we never had x, y and z", like one graduating student who had RPL:ed few courses said in an event.			

        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>The procedure</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Inform teachers that you want to RPL=AHOT Before the course starts!</li>
		<li>Gather enough work experience at work. Remember that you cannot use same hours for replacing multiple courses. E.g. student replacing 15 ECTS project, 30 ECTS work placement and doing 15 ECTS Diary thesis would need 400h + 800h + 400h = 1600h,
		equivalent of 10 months of full-time work.</li>
		<li>Get a testimonial (Työtodistus) which lists also the tasks you have been doing</li>
		<li>Schedule a meeting with the teacher</li>
		<li>Prepare the things you want to demonstrate</li>
		<li>Demonstrate e.g. project(s) to teacher. Confidential are ok if your employer agrees with it. Teachers usually don't want to get any copy of the code.</li>
		<li>Answer teacher's technical questions about code, projects, tools</li>
		<li>Answer teacher's questions about development process, teamwork, organization, methods, etc.</li>
		<li>(Possible write 1-2 short essays or do an exam teacher gives. This happens sometimes, not often)</li>
	</ol>
